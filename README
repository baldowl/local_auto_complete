= Local Auto Complete

Speeding up the autocompletion feature using Script.aculo.us'
Autocompleter.Local.

== Installation

  script/plugin install git://github.com/baldowl/local_auto_complete.git

== Usage

Quite simple:

* changed a bit the controller:

    class PeopleController < ApplicationController
      local_auto_complete_for :person, :name
    end

* replace the text_field or text_field_tag helper in the view with:

    <%= text_field_with_local_auto_complete :contact, :name %>

  Please, note that it's not a FormBuilder's helper, so you *must* follow
  text_field_tag syntax (yes, you can mix FormBuilder's helpers with *_tag
  ones)

* change your RESTful routes a bit:

    map.resources :contacts,
      :collection => {:auto_complete_for_contact_name => :get}
